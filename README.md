# Design Pattern - Chain Of Responsibility


I've Implemented the Chain Of Responsibility Pattern
in this project, where we are trying to pick a file from a specific path for reading the data and saving that data into the database, In this pattern we have created handlers like FileCheckDirectoryPathHandler, FileCheckExistsHandler, FileContentHandler and FileDataReadHandler which is responsible for processing/validating the file and passing that file to the next handler for further processing
